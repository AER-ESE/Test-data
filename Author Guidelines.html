We encourage you to spend your time ensuring that the content and key messages are clear rather than conforming to specific formatting requirements.<br />
<h2><br />Quick checklist for initial submission</h2>
<p>Please follow this list for an initial submission to the journal for <strong>all articles</strong><strong>:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Continuous line numbering throughout the text</li>
<li>A single column (and preferably double line-spacing which is helpful for reviewers)</li>
<li><strong>Title page</strong> consisting of a concise and informative title; a list of all authors' names and addresses; and the name, address and e-mail address of the corresponding author</li>
<li><strong>Abstract</strong> of no more than 350 words which should list the main results and conclusions, using simple, factual (and preferably numbered) statements</li>
<li><strong>Keywords</strong></li>
<li>Section headings which are appropriate to the content; see&nbsp;<a href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/hub/journal/26888319/author_guidelines#ArticleTypes">Article types</a>&nbsp;for details</li>
<li><strong>Authors&rsquo; contributions</strong></li>
<li><strong>Data availability statement</strong> indicating where you intend to archive your data or details of any data archiving waiver request in&nbsp;<a href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/hub/data_archiving_policy">accordance with our policy</a></li>
<li><strong>References</strong>: these do not need to be formatted but we prefer in-text citations provided in author and year format, rather than numerical</li>
<li><strong>Data sources</strong> (where appropriate)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are subsequently asked to submit a revision or resubmission there are <a href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/hub/journal/26888319/about/fullauthorguidelines.html">additional guidelines to follow</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a id="ArticleTypes"></a>Article types</h3>
<p><strong>Research Articles </strong>should be no more than 7000 words in length (including references) and structured with the following subheadings: Introduction, Materials and Methods, Results, Discussion, References. Full guidelines and specifications for each section are available <a href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/hub/journal/26888319/about/fullauthorguidelines.html?pbEditor=true#manuscriptstructure">here</a>, however, you do not need to format your article according to the full at initial submission.</p>
<p><strong><br />From Practice </strong>are short (max. 3500 words) articles with format and section headings selected according to the content of the manuscript. At least one author should be a practitioner or have direct experience of the practical management of the environment. From Practice papers are intended to provide practitioners with a venue for communicating with a broad audience and are flexible in terms of subject matter and format. These can include case studies of successful projects, calls for new approaches for dealing with persistent problems or perspectives on research topics relevant for management. The article should make clear recommendations regarding how the issue can be taken forward to ensure improved science-based practice.</p>
<p><strong><br />Reviews </strong>provide syntheses of topical themes. They should also offer insights or perspectives to guide future efforts in research or practice. Reviews should not exceed 8000 words (including references). Reviews are written in essay format with the subject headings selected according to the content of the manuscript.</p>
<p><strong><br />Perspectives</strong> are short essay-style articles to propose ideas or stimulate debate. They should generally be no more than 3500 words. Perspectives can offer conceptual advances or opinions, but should be evidence-based and have a solid grounding in the published literature. The format and section headings should be selected according to the content of the manuscript. Perspectives can include data where helpful to provide context and support the points raised.</p>
<p><strong><br />Forum Articles </strong>are short communications presenting opinions on, or responses to, material published in the journal. Reanalysis of the original data presented in the focal article is encouraged, however new data should not generally be presented. Forums should be submitted in a timely manner, ideally within 12 months of publication of the original article. Forum Articles will be assessed by the journal Editorial Board and will usually be sent for external peer review. If accepted, they will be held from publication while the authors of the original article are invited to respond. Authors of the original article are not required to write a forum response and are given a set time frame if they choose to do so. If accepted, both Forum Articles will then be published together in an issue. If factual errors with the data or analyses presented in the original article come to light, these will be investigated before publication of the Forum Article(s) and a correction notice will be published either instead of or as well as the Forum Article(s).</p>
<p><strong><br />Data Articles</strong> describe datasets with applied ecological value and provide the metadata and context to allow the data to be used and analysed. Data Articles enable the producers of datasets to gain visibility and credit for sharing data; ensure a high standard of usability and foster collaborations; and further allow authors to describe the importance and value of their data. Data and metadata preparation should follow the <a href="https://www.force11.org/group/fairgroup/fairprinciples">FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable)</a> Data Articles should be short (max. 3000 words) and structured as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><u>Introduction: </u>A brief description of the motivation and value of the data collection exercise; the questions underpinning data collection; and the general process leading up to data collection.</li>
<li><u>Materials and methods</u>: Any technical or methodological information that may help others to understand how the data were generated (i.e. equipment or procedures). Location information such as geo-coordinates or the name of the location(s) where data were collected should also be included</li>
<li><u>Usage notes</u>: Any technical or methodological information that may help others determine how the data may be properly re-used, replicated, or re-analysed</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">General patterns</span>: describe the overall patterns shown by the data, using summary figures or tables where appropriate</li>
<li><u>Related works (if appropriate)</u>: Indicate other resources that are associated with the data such as publications, reports, other datasets and code. Provide a brief summary of the results of any completed analyses</li>
<li><u>Funding information</u>: Name of the funding organization that supported creation of the resource, including applicable grant number(s)</li>
<li><u>Dataset details</u>: Information on how to access the data, including the permanent identifier and citation if the dataset is stored in a publicly available archive</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><br />Registered reports</strong> are a new form of empirical article in which the methods and proposed analyses are pre-registered and reviewed prior to research being conducted. This format is designed to minimize bias in deductive science, while also allowing complete flexibility to conduct exploratory (unregistered) analyses and report serendipitous findings. More information on registered reports and full guidelines can be found <a href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/hub/journal/26888319/registered-reports-author-guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

</ul>
<p>As reviewers often have very different expertise, the review process includes a 5-day discussion period after all reviews have been submitted in which all reviewers are given the opportunity to comment on each other's reports. After this time, the comments are then incorporated into the decision by the Editors.</p>
<p><em>Ecological Solutions and Evidence</em> participates in transparent peer review for published articles. By submitting to this journal, authors are automatically opted into the transparent process. If an article is accepted the reviewer reports, authors&rsquo; responses, and the editor's decision letter (including Associate Editor comments) will be published on Publons and the published article will include a direct link to these review details. Authors have the opportunity to opt out during the submission process, and reviewers can decide whether or not they want their name to appear alongside their report when it is published. You can find out more <a href="https://jecologyblog.com/2019/11/05/transparent-peer-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>The BES is a member of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ithenticate.com/products/crossref-similarity-check">CrossCheck</a>, and reserves the right to screen all submitted articles against the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ithenticate.com/products/crossref-similarity-check">CrossCheck</a>&nbsp;database, used to identify overlaps between submissions and previously published works.</p>
<p>Rejected manuscripts may be offered the option of having the paper, along with any reviews, transferred for consideration by the Editors of&nbsp;<em>Ecology and Evolution</em>. More details are provided on the&nbsp;<a href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/hub/editorial-policies">Editorial Policies</a>&nbsp;page.</p>
<p>Authors wishing to appeal a decision should outline their reasons for the appeal in an e-mail to editorial@ecologicalsolutionsandevidence.org. The editorial team will consider the appeal, reply to the authors and take any appropriate action. Note, however, that each submission is considered carefully at the first assessment and decisions to reject a manuscript are not taken lightly.&nbsp;</p><html xmlns:mso="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" xmlns:msdt="uuid:C2F41010-65B3-11d1-A29F-00AA00C14882"><head>
